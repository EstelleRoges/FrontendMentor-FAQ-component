## Overview

### The challenge
Your challenge is to build out this FAQ accordion card and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

    - View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
    - See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
    - Hide/Show the answer to a question when the question is clicked
    - **Bonus**: Complete the challenge without using JavaScript

## My process

### Built with

- HTML5
- CSS (yes, plain CSS, I wanted to practice the attributes a bit).

### What I learned

A lot! 
First, the <details> tag. That blew my mind. Today, everything is "made easier" because of frameworks and all but the good ol' HTML/CSS duo is still pretty powerful!
The <picture> tag was also a cool thing to hear about!
I don't think it's a surprise to say that the pictures were a pain in the neck...always moving in the wrong places! Ugh...
well...that made me practice CSS a lot, so that's cool.
